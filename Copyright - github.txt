Copyright - Important - Read Me 

Hello my name is Erik Luis Lanuza Oehlerich and welcome to my place.

In this repository i will add all my files and code in a organised way:

There is a free use of what i add of files and code as long it is for a noncomercial or a scientific use and i am creditted by my full name, somewhere public in your work:

Either add "Erik Luis Lanuza Oehlerich" or you can add an abbreviation "E.L.L.O" to your document.

I will also be uploading a full guide complete with documentation for my work.

But still please add my name somewhere in your project.  

I hope that you might find something you need, or that you learn something new while looking at my files.

:)
